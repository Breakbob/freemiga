	help
	  The AROS Research Operating System is a lightweight,
	  efficient, and flexible desktop operating system,
	  designed to help you make the most of your computer.
	  It's an independent, portable and free project,
	  aiming at being compatible with AmigaOS at the
	  API level (like Wine, unlike UAE), while improving
	  on it in many areas. The source code is available
	  under an open source license, which allows anyone
	  to freely improve upon it.
